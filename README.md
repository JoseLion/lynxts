# Lynx.ts

TypeScript-first, lightning fast Forms for React.js and React Native.

## How it works

Lynx.ts is a [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) based Form Provider. However, thanks to the brilliant [use-context-selector](https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector) the re-renders caused by changes in the context are drastically reduced. The `use-context-selector` hook implements [React's RFC context selector](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/119) in user land, this way we can specifically select what we need from the context and avoid unnecessary re-renders when unused parts of the context change.

Being a TypeScript-first library, you'll find type-safety on every turn: validation, simple/array/nested fields, form submision, etc. The codebase also follows a [full memoization principle](https://attardi.org/why-we-memo-all-the-things/), which makes Lynx.ts fast and performant on small or big projects.

## Compatibility

Lynx.ts is based on context and hooks, so you'll need a minimun version of `v16.8.0` on React.js. TypeScript is not necessary to use it, it works on plain JavaScript too! However, TS will give you a better dev experience and static check safety, so it's recommended.

## Usage

Lynx.ts is split three packages for convinience:

- **[@lynxts/core](./packages/core/README.md):** Main functionalities, can be used in any kind of React.js environment.
- **[@lynxts/native](./packages/native/README.md):** React Native specific abstractions and helpers.
- **[@lynxts/web](./packages/web/README.md):** DOM specific abstractions and helpers.

Check each package documentation for more details on how to use them.

## Design and next steps

Validation is a crutial part of forms in most cases. For Lynx.ts validation is always required, but because it can be a whole project out on its own, validation is supported through 3rd-party libraries. Both [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) schemas are supported out-of-the-box, but you can use any other library by just implementing an `Adapter<T>` which tells the form how to validate the schema. Check the Core package documentation for more details on [custom validation adapters](./packages/core/README.md#validation-adapters). In the remote case you don't need to validate your forms, we provide a `noValidate()` adapter which you can use as well.

Errors are present only if the **field was touched or the form submitted**. Adding other behaviors to how errors show will be based on requests and their use cases. Feel free to open an issue and share yours!
